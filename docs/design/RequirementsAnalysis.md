# Requirements Analysis
## Background
The Bookshop holds stock (Books) on shelves for customers to browse and in a closed store room at the back of the shop.  Visible stock is grouped by Genre, then arranged by author and title.

When a Customer pays, they have the option to take the items straight out of the Bookshop or pay a little extra for delivery to a nominated postal address.

Some customers may ask a member of staff if a particular book is available/on order or for general information about a particular authors/publishers books.

When not with customers, staff are responsible for keeping products correctly stocked on the shelves and ordering stock when existing levels get low.  A ledger is kept to track current stock levels and previous stock orders.  From time to time audits are carried out to ensure the ledger is kept accurate.

The ledger also records the addition of new stock items (new releases/historic reprints) when they are ordered.

Stock orders are recorded so staff can see when books were ordered, where they were ordered from and all outstanding orders.
