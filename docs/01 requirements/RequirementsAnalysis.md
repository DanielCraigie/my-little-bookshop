# Analysis
## Background
The Bookshop holds stock (Books) on shelves for customers to browse and in a closed store room at the back of the shop.
Visible stock is grouped by Genre, then arranged by author and title.

When a Customer pays, they have the option to take the items straight out of the Bookshop or pay a little extra for delivery to a nominated postal address on a target date.

Some customers may ask a member of staff if a particular book is available/on order or for general information about a particular author's/publisher's books.

When not with customers, staff are responsible for keeping products correctly stocked on the shelves and ordering stock when existing levels get low.
A ledger is kept to track current stock levels and orders.
From time to time audits are carried out to ensure the ledger is kept accurate.

The ledger records the ordering of new stock items (new releases/historic reprints) from suppliers.
Ordered items are not counted toward the shops stock until they have been received from the supplier.

Once delivered, items are checked against the order to confirm the correct items/quantities have arrived before being added to the stock ledger.
Order inconsistencies are recorded and taken up with the supplier by the shop manager who is responsible for reconciling invoices.

## Requirements
The system must provide the following functionality:
1. Keep a running stock record of items available for sale
2. Record sales of items to customers
3.
