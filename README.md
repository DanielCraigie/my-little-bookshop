# My Little Bookshop
This project is a DynamoDB learning exercise to create a PHP App to run my Bookshop.

It's going to start as a backend CLI app to begin with while I get the DB integration & data modelling sorted.

I currently intend to bolt on a Vue.js web App to provide an iteractive front end later (maybe throw some GraphQL in as well).

## Objectives

- Have fun
- Gain a better understanding of DynamoDB and NoSQL data modelling (coming from an SQL background)
- Learn how to integrate DynamoDB with PHP*

*Project will be ported to Python if it goes well and I decide to create a Lambda driven API Gateway infrastructure
